# Copilot Instructions

## Self-Update Policy
- Copilot should regularly review and update this file to reflect new project conventions, workflows, and best practices.
- All major changes to project structure, memory banking, or workflow should be documented here.

## Memory Banking Structure
- Project memory is stored in the `vibes/` folder:
  - `vibes/state.md`: Current project state and status.
  - `vibes/decisions.md`: Key decisions, rationale, and alternatives considered.
  - `vibes/learnings.md`: Lessons learned, pitfalls, and best practices.
- Copilot should update these files as the project evolves.

## TODO List
- The TODO list should be maintained in `vibes/todo.md`.
- Each item should be actionable, concise, and checked off when completed.

## Collaboration
- All contributors should read and follow these instructions.
- Use the memory banking files to onboard, review history, and avoid repeating past mistakes.
